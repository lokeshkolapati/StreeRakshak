# 🌸 Stree Rakshak

**Stree Rakshak** is a safety-focused web application that helps women travel from one location to another using the **Google Maps API** while considering the **crime index** of different areas.  
It prioritizes safer routes using **K-Means clustering** on crime data to ensure a secure journey.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** – Crime data is stored in `crime.csv` and processed into `data.json`.
2. **Clustering** – Python scripts (`kmeans.py`) apply K-Means to group areas by crime severity.
3. **Route Calculation** – Google Maps API fetches possible routes.
4. **Safety Ranking** – Routes passing through low-crime clusters are prioritized.
5. **Display** – Results are shown on an interactive Google Map interface.
